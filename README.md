# Search Albums and Like Songs

## Basic story of application:
This application was meant to present a list of albums. Using TOMORROW X TOGETHER's discography page as reference, I was able to create a display of +x+ album covers and list each of the albums respective songs with a press of a button. With the knowledge that I've learned throughout phase-1, you can be able to search a  specific album and like your favorite songs.
