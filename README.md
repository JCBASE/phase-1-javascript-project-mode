# Search Albums and Like Songs

## Basic story of application:
This application was meant to present a list of albums. Using TOMORROW X TOGETHER's discography page (July 2023) as reference, I was able to create a display of +x+ album covers and list each of the albums respective songs with a press of a button. With the knowledge that I've learned throughout phase-1, you can be able to search a specific album and like your favorite songs.

## Core Features of MVP:
* A search bar that searches albums by ID.
* Lists titles of the ablums and images of the album covers.
* Button provides song titles.
* Clickable hearts next to each song title.
* A button that toggles dark mode.

## API Data:
db.json file using json-sever that returns an array of 8 album objects with each object having 4 attributes.

**Attributes**: 
- ID 
- title 
- image
- tracks

Initially, the data will be fetched and for each data the keys will render in cards comprised of a title, an image, and a Songs button. The "id" data will be fetched in a form based on what the user types and the "title" and "image" data will be rendered and displayed for that id. Once the user clicks the Songs button, the "id" data will be fetched again and the "tracks" data will be rendered by its respective id.
