# Search Albums and Like Songs

## Basic story of application:
This application was meant to present a list of albums. Using TOMORROW X TOGETHER's discography page (July 2023) as reference, I was able to create a display of +x+ album covers and list each of the albums respective songs with a press of a button. With the knowledge that I've learned throughout phase-1, you can be able to search a specific album and like your favorite songs.

## Core Features of MVP:
* A search bar that searches albums by ID.
* Lists titles of the ablums and images of the album covers.
* Button provides song titles.
* Clickable hearts next to each song title.
* A button that toggles dark mode.
